## 📁 CSV Support

Place your CSVs in `/public/csv/`. Supported files include:

- `categories.csv`
- `products.csv`
- `orders.csv`
- `customers.csv`
- `employees.csv`
- `suppliers.csv`


> These are dummy CSVs from the Northwind dataset. Relations are not enforced — data is mocked independently.

## 🚦 Sample Query Dropdown Behavior

### Challenge:
Long queries (e.g. with binary fields like `picture`) can overflow or break layout in a `<select>` dropdown.

### Solution:

- ✅ Query dropdown options are truncated with `...` using JavaScript.
- ✅ Full query is shown in a `<textarea>` below the dropdown for editing and readability.
- ✅ `title` attribute is added so hovering the dropdown option shows full query.

### Future Improvement:
Want a smoother UX? Use a custom dropdown like `react-select` for wrapping, searching, tagging, and better scroll support.

## 🛠 Performance

- **Initial Load Time:** ~2s (tested in Chrome DevTools → Performance tab)
- **Optimizations Used:**
  - Lazy CSV loading
  - Memoization of filters and data
  - Pagination to limit DOM rows
  - Component-level separation

---

## 📄 PDF Export

Exports current visible table data into a downloadable PDF using `jsPDF` + `autotable`. Maintains headers and rows from your current view (including filters).

---

## 🧪 Query Validation

Sample queries are validated using basic pattern-matching. Supports:

```
SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = 'value';
```

---

## 🧹 Reset Button

Click "Reset" to:

- Clear all active filters
- Reload full table
- Reset sample query textarea
